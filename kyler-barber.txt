1. Sematic html is the information in webpages and web applications rather than defining its look.
2.Html is used to create electronic documents. basically web pages.
3. attributes are special words used inside of an opening tag to control certain behaviors.
4. I feel like you should only used an H1 tag only once, because its a header and not a sub category.
5. two tags that are required on an html document is doctype,html, title, and body.
6. you would use the attribute called head.
7. This unique attribute carries value. its special in html.
8. this can be used for style sheet selecting, a reference, or a named anchor tag.
9. you can use as many ids as you like on the page, but most of it wont be valid.
10. the class element specifies one or more class elements. it can also be used in css and javascript.
11. any element may be used by it, but a few wont allow it like base, head, html, meta, param, script, style, and title.
12. well I guess forever, but the class attribute can only be attached to one element at a time.
13. I usually right click it and use the open in new tab button. 
14. the alt attribute is used to provide alternative information for an image if the user cannot view it.
15. html has elements written in it and to reference it I would have to call it out based on the element.
16. the section element is used for chapters, headers, and footers. the div element is a true divider, this particular tag is used to group block elements.
17. css is a cascading style sheet. its used for design, you know bringing your work to life.
18. h1 {     }  thats the example.
19. the id can describe one element, but the class can select multiple elements.
20. you would write a period. heres an example, .apple{    }
21. you would use the head.callout method.
22.we use this thing called the child selector. this is used for elements that have direct children of other elements. this may be useful when you need to select other children within a element.

35. I believe you should commit when you make major changes.
36. we use git init first then git commit -m then git add . or git push -u "branch-name"
37. correct me if I am wrong. you would create your own repo. add your TL as a collaborator. clone that repo you're working with then open your terminal after copying the repo url address. don't forget to create a branch and then a file
within this branch. cd into it and push your changes. after that get your TL to review it.
