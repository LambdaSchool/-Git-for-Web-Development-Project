## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git? Git is a DevOps tool used for source code management. It's a freeversion control system that is open source. It's used to everything from small to very large projects. Git is used to track changes in the source code allowing multiple developers to work together.
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub? Git is a version control system that helps you manage and track source code history. GitHub is a cloud based hosting service that lets you manage your Git repositories.
3. Why do we create a branch? We create a branch to isolate changes made to code. It's used when you want to create a new feature or fix a bug.
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request? A pull request lets you tell others about changes you've made to a branch on GitHub. It allows you to discuss and review potential changes with collaborators. 
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main. Git checkout
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do? 'git fetch' command downloads commits, files, and refs from a remote repository into your local repo. 'git merge' is a way to put a forked history back together. It lets you take independent lines of development and integrate them. 'git pull' is used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that content. 
7. What is a merge conflict? Merge conflicts happen when competing/ conflicting changes are mafe to the same lone of a file. It can also happen when one person edits a file awhile another deletes it. 
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict? The easiest way is to open is amd make changes. Then you use git add to stage the merged content and create a new commit with git commit.
