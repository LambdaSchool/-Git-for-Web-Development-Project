Stretch Questions

1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
Block elements always start on new lines, where inline elements don't. Block elements take up full width while inline elements dont. Block elements have top and bottom margins, inline elements don't.
2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
When an element is positioned absolutely it won't move around as other elements do.
3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
Margin with auto, I think.
4. Name 3 elements that are display block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
<ul>,<ol>,<p> are display block. <a> and <nav> are inline. <button> is inline block by default.
5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 
A webpage is basically just a set of content boxes superimposed onto each other. Paragraphs in boxes with borders and margins on bourders on outlines. Setting either a width or a height to auto can help.
