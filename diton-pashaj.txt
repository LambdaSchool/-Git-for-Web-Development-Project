Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
     inline element does not have a line break. It is continous. It is used within other HTML elements. you can't put block elements inside inline elements. <a> and <img> are examples of inlne elements. 
    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
    Absolute positoning of an element means that it will not be a part of the flow in relation to other elements. It will stay at the same exact position. Other elements might overlap with it. 
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
   display block --> <header>, <footer>, <section>
   display inline block --> <a>, <img>
    display inline block--> <button>
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model? 
    Any element can be considered a box. It has content, padding, border and margin. The box model is helpful because it allows us to add borders and define space around elements. Maybe my brain is fried at this moment but I do not know what you mean by `what is the fix..`.
