<i align="cetner">In this project you will be using the concepts learned in the Git for Web Development lesson to <code>fork clone push</code>and submit a PR for each project during this sprint.</i>


<h2 align="center">Objectives</h2>
 <ul>
  <li>âœ… | Create your own version of this repo with <code>fork</code></li>
  <li>âœ… | Add your TL as a collaborator</li>
  <li>âœ… | <code>clone</code> this repo</li>
  <li>âœ… | Create a branch <code>git checkout -b 'firstName-lastName</code></li>
  a. [âœ”] Add a file to the project called `yourFirstName-yourLastName`.txt. This file can contain anything.
  b. [âœ”] Run your usual git commands for adding/commiting and pushing **Be sure to push to your branch!**
  c. [âœ”] Create a Pull-Request to submit your work
  d. [âœ”] Use your own student fork as the base (compare across forks, base-fork -> master).
  <li>Add your TL as a reviewer on the Pull-Request
5. [ ] TL then will count the Assignment as done by merging the HW back into master "STUDENT FORK".



1. [âœ”] Add your TL as a collaborator to your fork. 
2. [âœ”] Go into your project folder, make a new branch `firstname-lastname`
3. [âœ”] Add your first and last name to the README.md file in the project and save.
4. [âœ”] add/commit/and push to your own branch  **Be sure to push to your branch!**
5. [âœ”] Create a Pull-Request to submit your work
  i. [âœ”] Use your own student fork as the base (compare across forks, base-fork -> master).

<i>While the processes learned here will set you up to be successful in most situations, they are just the tip of the iceberg in learning Git. Independantly research the following topics to learn more about Git.</i>

<h3>Topics</h3>
<ol>

 <li>âœ… | Research and understand what a <code>merge conflict</code> is and how to resolve it.
 <blockquote><i>a <b>merge conflict</b> means two conflicting commits are trying to merge into master and Git needs the user to decide which commit to send.<br>Easiest way to resolve os to choose the most updated commit and <code>re-stage, commit, and push</code></blockquote><br></li>

 <li>âœ… | Reseach the Git commands <code>pull</code>, <code>rebase</code>, <code>merge</code>.  These commands will allow you to bring in changes that other developers push to the master branch.
      i. `pull`: _updates local clone with latest commit from Git repo._
      ii. `rebase`: _rewrites repo git history by restructuring got commits to new first commit._
      iii. `merge`: _combines a branch checkouted frorm master back into master_
  </li>

  <li>Reseach the Git commands `reset `, `revert`, `clean`. These commands will allow you to go back and ammends previous commits you have made.
      i. `reset`:
      ii. `revert`:
      iii. `clean`:

<li>Research and set up a Graphical User Interface (GUI) Git console.
