# Git for Web Development Project
In this project you will be using the concepts learned in the Git for Web Development lesson to fork/clone/push/and submit a PR for each project during this sprint.

This project consists of two parts:

## Task 1: Set up Project
You will need to follow the BloomTech Git Workflow to add a file to this project follow the steps below:

- [ ] Create your own version of this repo - Fork
- [ ] Clone this repo
- [ ] Create a branch `git checkout -b 'firstName-lastName'`
  - [ ] Add a file to the project called `yourFirstName-yourLastName`.txt. This should contain the link to your completed codepen from part 2 as well as the review questions/answers
  - [ ] Run your usual git commands for adding/committing and pushing **Be sure to push to your branch!**
- [ ] Create a Pull-Request to submit your work
  - [ ] Use your own student fork as the base (compare across forks, base-fork -> main).


1. What is git? What is the difference between git and GitHub?

Git is a distrubuted version control system.  Git hub is web based repository system.

2. Why do we create a branch? 

To write code seperate from the main.

3. What is the purpose of a pull request? 

To show the differences of the master version and your version.

4. What is the command you can use to switch between branches?
For example you are working on a feature branch and you want to switch back to main. 

git checkout -b

5. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull` what does each command do? 

Git fetch downloads the commits,files, etc from the remote repository (github).  Git pull takes the information from the remote repository and immidiately updates the local repository with that information.  Git merge will merge branches together.

6. What is a merge conflict? How do you resolve a merge conflict? 

A merge conflict is when 2 or more people are editing the same line of code, or if someone deletes the line someone else is working on.  To see if there's an issue you can use Git status.
