## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git? 
Git is a free and open source distributed code management and Version control system
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?

3. Why do we create a branch? 
To safely experiment with changes without affecting the main branch which also allows for other developers to simultanteously work at the same time
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?
Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub.
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.
git checkout main would switch from FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME to main.
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?
'git fetch' command downloads commits, refs, and files from the remote repository to the local repository. 'git merge' merges branches together. 'git pull' does both
7. What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict occurs when you merge branches that have competing commits
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?
You can run --skip, --abort, or decide which branch to keep or create a new branch which may incorporate changes from both branches
