## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git? Git is an Open Source Distributed Version Control System
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub? GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service for git. One would use GitHub in order to collaborate with others on Git projects
3. Why do we create a branch? So users can edit projects without impeding the work of the other users on a project
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request? A Pull Request is a way to notify other users on the same project what changes you made in a single branch of work
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main. git switch main
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do? 'git fetch' saves the changes made to the local repository. 'git merge' adds the repository to a working directory of repositories. 'git pull' combines both of those actions together.
7. What is a merge conflict? When 2 or more different branches by 2 or more different users have conflicting changes on the same line of code in the same project
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict? Creating a new commit with resolved changes by all users involved in the conflict.
