## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git? a version control system .
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub? Github is a cloudbased hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories.
3. Why do we create a branch? to isolate specific Git commits from the rest of your main Git history.
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request? it allows you to tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on Github.
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main. git switch.
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do? git fetch is used to download contents from a remote repository. git merge lets you take the independent lines of development created by git branch and integrate them into a single branch. git pull is used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that content.
7. What is a merge conflict? a merge conflict is an event that takes place when Git is unable to automatically resolve differences in code between two commits.
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict? The easiest way to resolve a conflicted file is to open it and make any necessary changes.
After editing the file, we can use the git add a command to stage the new merged content.
