## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git?
	Git is a open and free source distributed version control system that handle 
	small to large projects.

2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
	Git is a tool that's used to manage multiple versions of source code edits that 
	are then transferred to files in a Git repository, GitHub serves as a location for 
	uploading copies of a Git repository.

3. Why do we create a branch? 
	We do this to give ourselves the freedom to independently work on different 
	modules.

4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?
	This tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on 
	GitHub.

5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.
	The command to switching between branches is "git checkout"

6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?
	Git fetch downloads the content from the remote repository.
	Git merge is when you merge the remote content in the main branch.
	Git pull fetch and download content from a remote repository to match content

7. What is a merge conflict?
	This happens when one person edits a file and another person deletes the same 
	file.

8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?
	The easiest way to resolve a conflicted file is to open it and make any 
	necessary changes. After editing the file, we can use the git add a command to 
	stage the new merged content. The final step is to create a new commit with the help of 
	the git commit command.
