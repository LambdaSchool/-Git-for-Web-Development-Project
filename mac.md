## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git?
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
3. Why do we create a branch? 
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?
7. What is a merge conflict?
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?

1. Git allows us to keep track if the changes to our code, also good to have good collaboration with other web devs. Well be using this alot even when we get a job in web development!
2. The differance between git and github is Git is a command you use in your terminal also keeps track of your code overtime! Github is a cloud based website that keeps track of your repositories and will keep past versions of the code just in case you hit a unexpected bug in your code!
3. If you have a bunch of people working on the same code at a time, so when we push a code, our senior developers or anyone in that sort can look over the code then push it into the main branch
4. With pull request is how you can see the changes that were made to code, it is also how you get code from a featured branch or bug fix branch into the main branch !
5. cd ..
6. git fetch only downloads latest changes into the local repository. Git pull downloads latest changes into the local repository and also automatically merges changes into your working directory. git merge will merge changes after you do git fetch, compared to git pull automatically does it all. For git fetch you will do git merge in order to merge all changes to your repositories.
7. Merge conflicts happen when competing changes are made to the same line of a file or someone deletes the same file.
8. You either choose to delete or you can keep the removed file in a new commit!
