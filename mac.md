## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git? 
    Git is a version control system. You can create branches and see and keep track of the changes you do over time.

3. Why do we create a branch? 
    we create a branch so that we can know who is working on what and so that we do not commit changes to the main branch. It also helps to not reintroduce bugs

4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?
    A pull request is to let other team members know that you have made changes to your branch in a respository. you can use pull requests to get feedback from your teammates and merge to the main if satisfied with the changes. 

5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.
    git switch

6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?
    git fetch: to retrieve new work done by other people
    git merge: take the independent lines of development created by git branch and integrate them into a single branch
    git pull: to fetch and download content from a remoe repository and immediately update the local repository to match that content 

7. What is a merge conflict?
    a merge conflict is an event that takes place when Git is unable to automatically resolve differences in code between two commits, most likely because commits are the same between two branches. 

8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?
    To resolve a merge conflict, you would need to open up the file and make the necessary changes, then go through the steps of commiting changes to the git hub
