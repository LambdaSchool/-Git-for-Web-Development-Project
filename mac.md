## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git?
Software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development.
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history. GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories.
3. Why do we create a branch? 
We create a branch to maintain stability in our main code while isolated changes are made to the code.
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?
Pull request is to notify team members that a feature or fix, developed on a separate branch is ready to be reviewed.
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.
cd
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?
git fetch: downloads commits from a remote repository into your local repo. 
git merge: connects the forked history together.
git pull: fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that content. 
7. What is a merge conflict?
An event that takes place when Git is unable to automatically resolve differences in code between two commits.
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?
By editing the files that are conflicting and re commiting.
