## Research Questions

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git? Git is an open source distributed version control system.
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub? Git is a system that lets you manage and keep trackof your source code history. gitHub is a cloud for said Git
3. Why do we create a branch?  branch acts as a pointer in which it can hold certain things that are in your code such as bugs or other things and encapsulates them
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request? Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub.
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main. -- get checkout -b
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do? git fetch = is a primary command used to download contents from a remote repository.  The git merge command = lets you take the independent lines of development created by git branch and integrate them into a single branch.  and git pull lets you pull the updated work shared with someone
7. What is a merge conflict? When you merge branches that have competing commits
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict? Go inside the file and make the necessary fixes.  then you would git add then git commit with a different name.
