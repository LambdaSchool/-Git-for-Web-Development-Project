## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git?
git is a program

2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
github is a cloud to store codes and Git is a program

3. Why do we create a branch?
We create a branch so that multiple people can work on the same project 
It's a copy of the main code so that you can edit it.
At the end, you will eventually merge it back to the main code.
 
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?
a pull request lets you tell others what changes you made to the file so that it can eventually be merged


5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.
git checkout <branch> //to change branch 
git branch //to check if the branch exist
git checkout -b <branchname> //to create a new branch

6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?
git fetch //download from the cloud 
git merge// fix the fork
git pull//used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that content

7. What is a merge conflict?

merge conflict happens when you merge branches that have competing commits. 
git will need your help to decide which changes should be added.

8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?
you must manually edit the conflicted file.
