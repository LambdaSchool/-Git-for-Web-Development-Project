## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git?
 Git is a software where users can track their work 
and work on projects.
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
Git is where you actually work on your project while GitHub is the 
place that stores your work and the work of other software 
engineers and allows other software engineers to clone and work on 
the project o their own branch.
 3. Why do we create a branch?
We create a branch so we can create our own code without actually 
pushing it to the main stream.
 4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?
You would be pulling the entire project as a whole that multiple 
people has worked on rather than individual pieces of a project.
5. What is the command you can use to switch between 
branches?  For example you are working on FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME bra
nch and you want to switch back to main.
cd "directory you would like to go"
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `
git pull`. What does each command do?
git fetch downloads commits from a remote repository into 
your computer. git merge puts the forked code someone else 
created into the main branch. git pull gets the content 
from a remote repository and updates the local repository 
to match.
 7. What is a merge conflict?
When you try to push code up but someone already pushed 
code up.
 8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?
You would have to pull the project entirely before pushing 
the code up again.
