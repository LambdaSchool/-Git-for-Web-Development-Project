## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git? - Git is a free and open source version control system used to handle and change code in small to large projects. Allows multiple developers to work/edit on one or various projects.
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub? - Git is a version control system that allows you and other programmers to edit repositories where as GitHub is a repository hosting system/website.
3. Why do we create a branch? - We create a branch so we can make separate changes from the main branch that can later be compared or combined.
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request? - A pull request allows us show changes to a particular branch before merging with a main branch of a project.
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main. - git checkout -b 'Firstname-lastname'
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do? - 'git fetch' fetches all the changes from the remote repository and stores it in a separate branch in your local repository. 'git merge' takes all the changes made to a branch and combines it with another. 'git pull' does the same thing as 'git fetch & merge' at the same time.
7. What is a merge conflict? - Merge conflicts happen when you try to merge branches that have conflicting commits. 
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict? - We can resolve a merge conflict by simply opening the conflicting file or files and making the necessary changes so that they no longer conflict.
