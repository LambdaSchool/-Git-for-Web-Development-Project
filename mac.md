## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git? Version control, helps track changes in code.
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub? GitHub is a cloud 
storage, whereas Git is a system in place.
3. Why do we create a branch? To be able to write code without affecting 
original branch.
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request? To try to merge our code with 
the main branch if need be.
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example 
you are working on FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back 
to main. git checkout <branchName>
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. 
What does each command do? fetch downloads code from remote repo, merge 
merges code between branches, pull runs fetch with parameters.   7. What 
is a merge conflict? When branches conflict because local vs remote is not 
in sync.  8. How do you resolve a merge conflict? Update remote repo with 
local repo.
