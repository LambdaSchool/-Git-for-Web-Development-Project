## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git? Git is a version control system for tracking changes in 
files. :)

2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
Git is the actual files whereas github is the location where files are 
stored.

3. Why do we create a branch?
We create branches because they allow us to work on specific sections of 
a project independently, and because it makes it so we're not modifying 
the source code directly.
 
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?
A pull request allows us to update our local repository from a remote 
repo.

5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For 
example you are working on FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.
cd is the command used to move between branches.

6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?
'git fetch' allows us to retrieve the latest data info from an original 
file. 'Git merge' works on putting a forked history back together. 'git 
pull' updates a local version of a repository from remote. 

 7. What is a merge conflict?
a merge conflict is when the code from a local repository conflicts with 
that of the main repository and github can't resolve the code issue.

8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?
you look back to the different commit histories of the affected code and 
make changes to it so the conflict can be resolved.
