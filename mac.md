Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git?

A pull request let's your team know that you've made changes to the code that need to be reviewed.

git checkout 'branchName' you want to switch to.
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?
Git fetch allows you to download content from a remote reository. Git merge allows you to join branches that you have been working on back with the main branch. Git pull downloads content from a specific branch.

Merge conflict is when 2 people make different changes to the same line of code on different branches.

Merge code from main branch into your branch. Fix the conflicts, commit and push changes back to your branch, then merge to target branch.
