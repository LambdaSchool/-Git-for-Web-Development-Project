# Setting Up Your Computer

Welcome to day 1 at BloomTech, today we are going to spend time setting up your computer and learning the tools that you will be using to complete this program. Just like day 1 at a job, you will need to get your environment set up to build and run your code. Complete the set up tasks below and then get started on the research questions. Once you have finished check out the submission instructions in the `README.md` file to turn in your assignment for the day. 

## Set Up Tasks 
1. [X] [Download xcode](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) - these are your developer tools for mac 
2. [X] sign up for a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join) - please use a professional username. We recommending using your `firstname` `lastname`
3. [X] [Set up your SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) - GitHub uses SSH to keep their files secure. You will need to set up one SSH key for every computer that you want to access your GitHub account on. Please ensure you go through all of the steps to generate a new key, add a new key and test your connection.
4. [X] [Download Zoom](https://zoom.us/download) - make sure your zoom display name is your `first name` `last name`
5. [X] [Download Slack](https://slack.com/help/articles/207677868-Download-Slack-for-Mac) - make sure your slack display name is your `first name` `last name` 
6. [X] [Download VS code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) - this will be the tool you use to write all of your code. We recommend installing the following extensions: 
- [ES Lint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
- [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
- [Spell Checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker)
- [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)
7. [X] [Download Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/) - Please download the latest stable version. We will be using Node.JS to run the tests in all of our javaScript assignments. Test driven development is a common practice in the world of web dev. You can read more about it [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/test-driven-development-what-it-is-and-what-it-is-not-41fa6bca02a2/) 
8. [X] Sign up for a free [codepen account](https://codepen.io/accounts/signup/user/free)
9. [X] Sign up for a free account on [Lucid Chart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/landing?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign[â€¦]tTwOoXp_lCeLTC97pikTFa5cE58FWHwjjpTSGsGPRqR2AAaAh-MEALw_wcB)

## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You can type your answer below the questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en) doc short for documentation are the instructions on how to use a languge, or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your google skills. 

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and GitHub?
Git is known as an Open Source Distributed Version Control System. It is open source meaning anyone can find and look at your code from the internet. The Distributed Version Control System means that there is a version remotely on a server and also a local version on your local computer.  The difference between the two is that Git is the tool as stated above and Github is the service to use Git. We use Git on Github.
2. Why do we create a branch? 
We create branches to not affect the original code and essentially make our own copy that we can work on without affecting the original code.
3. What is the purpose of a pull request? 
The purpose is to tell others about what changes I have made to my branch. Once I have submitted the pull request, someone from my team reviews my code and can either accept or offer things to change.
4. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on a feature branch and you want to switch back to main. 
git checkout
5. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull` what does each command do? 
git fetch is the command to download commits, files and refs from a remote repository to your own local repository. You can also review commits before integrating them with your own local version. git merge is to merge your two separate branches and put them together as one branch. git pull is used to grab and download a branch from a remote location to a local location. It should be used if there is only one user working on the Main.
6. What is a merge conflict? How do you resolve a merge conflict? 
A merge conflict happens when someone deletes a file and someone else is edits that file too. To resolve this conflict, like if two people edited the same line of code, you must create a new commit before you can merge those two branches.
