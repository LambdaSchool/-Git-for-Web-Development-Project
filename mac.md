## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git? Git is a open source software for distributed version control, use to track changes in files. its used to coordinate work among programmers.
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub? Git is a version control program, Github is a hosting service at allow you to share your work with other developers so they can manage your code or vice versa.
3. Why do we create a branch? git branch -b new_branch
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request? lets you show others of changes you have pushed to a branch in a repo.
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main. git checkout
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do? The git fetch will downloads commits, files, and refs from a remote repository into your local repo. Git merge will lets you take the independent lines of development created by git branch and integrate them into a single branch. The git pull command is used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that content. What is a merge conflict? Merge conflicts occur when competing changes are made to the same line of a file, or when one person edits a file and another person deletes the same file. How do you resolve a merge conflict? You must choose which changes to incorporate from the different branches in a new commit.
