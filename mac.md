## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git? version control sysytem
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub? github stores local repos onto an online forum, git is commands for navigating the terminal.
3. Why do we create a branch? to alot us to make changes without directly affecting the original code.
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request? a pull request allows us to compare changes made. 
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main. cd (change directory)
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do? git merge uploads the code from your local terminal to the public. git fetch shows the changes youve made while staying local. git pull pulls down code and merges. 
7. What is a merge conflict? a complication in which code has commits that go against each other. 
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict? through github and pull requests you may see the merge conflict file, edit the file to remove the conflicting code, add commit and push with error rectified.
