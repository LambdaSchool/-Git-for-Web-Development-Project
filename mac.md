## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git?
A version control system, or VCS, tracks the history of changes as people and teams collaborate on projects together.
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
Git lets developers see the entire timeline of their changes, decisions, and progression of any project in one place. While gitHub hosts Git repositories and provides developers with tools to ship better code through command line features, issues , pull requests, code review, or the use of a collection of free and for-purchase apps in the GitHub Marketplace.
3. Why do we create a branch? 
Git branches are effectively a pointer to a snapshot of your changes.
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?
Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub.
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.
The command that you can use to switch between branches is 'git checkout'.
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?
The differnce is 'git fetch' will fetch down all the branches from that Git remote,'git merge' will  merge the specified branchâ€™s history into the current one and 'git pull' will fetch and merge any commits from the tracking remote branch.
7. What is a merge conflict?
Merge conflicts occur when competing changes are made to the same line of a file, or when one person edits a file and another person deletes the same file.
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?
Merge conflicts occur when competing changes are made to the same line of a file, or when one person edits a file and another person deletes the same file. You will have to open repo with merge error and generate list of the affected files. Use the following commands  <<<<<<< HEAD, =======, and >>>>>>> branch-a in the correct way. Lastly choose with branch or both to commit.
