## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git? Git is a distributed version control system
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub? Git lets you manage and keep track of your source code history. GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories.
3. Why do we create a branch? To maintain stability while isolated changes are made to code
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request? Lets you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do? Git fetch updates your remote-tracking branches. It's safe to run at any time since it never changes local branches. Git pull brings a local branch up to date with its remote version while also updating your other remote tracking branches. Git merge is a way of putting a forked history back together.
7. What is a merge conflict?  When competing changes are made to the same line of file or when one person edits a file and another person deletes the same file
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?  Opening it and edit necessary changes and create new commit
