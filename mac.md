## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git?
- Git is a version control system that can be used to track the changes that are made to computer files.

2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
- Git allows you to manage your changes in  source code, but GitHub is a very large cloud hosting service that allows you to manage your Git repositories.

3. Why do we create a branch? 
- We create a branch so that we can make changes to code and keep it organized. A new branch can be used so that others can see the changes that you made.

4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?
- A pull request is used to show changes that you've pushed to a branch.

5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.
- To switch branches you would use the gitcheckout command.

6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?
- Git fetch will check content from a remote repository so that you can see any remote commits that you may wish to add.
- Git merge will allow you to put forked history back together.
- Git pull will actually download content from a remote repository and add it to your local repository.

7. What is a merge conflict?
- A merge conflict can happen when there are competing line changes. It will be marked as conflicted, and the change must be fixed before moving on.

8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?
- A merge conflict can be resolved by editing the conflicted file, or using commands such as git checkout and git reset.
