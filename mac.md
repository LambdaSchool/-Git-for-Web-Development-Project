## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!


1. What is Git? 
   
   A free and open source distributed version control system.

2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
   
   Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history. GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories.

3. Why do we create a branch? 
  
   To maintain stability while isolated changes are made to code....

4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?
   Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub.

5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.
 
   git switch 

6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?
   
   git fetch is the command that tells your local git to retrieve the latest meta-data info from the original. git pull on the other hand does that and brings those changes from the remote repository.   
   Merging is Git's way of putting a forked history back together again. 


7. What is a merge conflict?
   
    An event that takes place when Git is unable to automatically resolve differences in code between two commits.

8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?

    You must choose whether to delete or keep the removed file in a new commit.
