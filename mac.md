## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself 
with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git? Git is an open source distributed version control system. 
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub? Git is a version control system where you 
can manage and track your source code history. GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service to 
manage your Git repositories.
3. Why do we create a branch? Creating a branch let the developer make changes and updates to 
the original code without making changes to the main branch.  
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request? A Pull request lets others know there are changed 
made thats been pushed to a branch.
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on 
FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main. 'git checkout'
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each 
command do? The git pull command send the updated code to the local version from the remote. 
The git merge command takes the edited branch and merge it back into the main branch. The git 
fetch command can download objects from one or more repository.
7. What is a merge conflict? A merge conflict occurs when competing changes are made and Git 
is automatically resolve the differences between two commits. 
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict? Most merge conflicts can be resolved on the command 
line but if multiple changes are made to the same line of the same file, than you would use 
GitHub.
