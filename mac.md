## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git? A branching mechanism that allows different software engineers code without breaking code. It allows you to control different versions before being added bck to the main code.
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub? Git is the commands, github is the website
3. Why do we create a branch? to allow us to work on code without breaking the main code that everyone else is working on. 
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request? to review a different version of the code. 
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main. git checkout main
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do? git fetch is used to download contents from a remote repository without affecting the local files.
git pull is getting the latest version of the branch in github and the local files are affected.
git merge puts the changes on one branch into another branch. 
7. What is a merge conflict? when changes on a branch cannot be resolved by git
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict? changing the code.
