## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git? Git is a source-code management tool.
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub? Git is a version control system, while GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories.
3. Why do we create a branch? So we can work on the task separately from the original version, and then so we can compare it with the main branch to merge the versions or track changes. 
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request? The pull request lets you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a GitHub repository.
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main. git checkout main
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do? git fetch lets you download objects from another repository, while git pull lets you fetch from and integrate with another repository or local branch. Git merge lets you merge one branch with other branches in a repository
7. What is a merge conflict? It occurs when there are unresolved different in codes between two commits
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?  Go on pull request and find the resolve conflict button, then proceed to make changes to the codes, then mark as resolved.
