## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git? Git is an open source distributed version control system.
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub? Git is an open source distributed version control system that lets you manage your source code history while Github is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories.
3. Why do we create a branch? To separate Git commits from the main git history
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request? To update local working branch as well as the remote-tracking branches for all other branches.
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main. git checkout -b
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do? git fetch command is used to download contents from a remote repository. git merge command lets you merge created independent lines of development into one branch. git pull command updates local working branch as well as the remote-tracking branches for all other branches.
7. What is a merge conflict? A merge conflict occurs when git is unable to merge branches because two or more branches have made edits to the same line in a file. 
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict? Edit the conflicted file.
