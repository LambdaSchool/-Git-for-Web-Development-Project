    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model?
    The box model is how elements are displayed on a page. An element has the space it takes up,
    then it's got padding which is space from the edge of the element to whatever size we give it,
    this padding can have a border and finally the margin of the entire box. Essentially, boxes
    within boxes.

    The "fix" to the box model is box-sizing: border-box which includes padding and borders into
    the element's width.
