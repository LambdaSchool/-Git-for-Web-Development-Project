Stretch Review questions: 
    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
    Block elements start on a new line and take up as much width as possible.
    Inline elements don't start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary.
    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
    Absolute positioning means an element is positioned relative to its parent element.
    (If there's no element, it will be positioned relative to the page itself)
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width?
    Make it an inline-block element.
    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
    display: block default: div, section & p
    display: inline default: span, img
    display: inline-block default: button
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model?
    The box model is how elements are displayed on a page. An element has the space it takes up,
    then it's got padding which is space from the edge of the element to whatever size we give it,
    this padding can have a border and finally the margin of the entire box. Essentially, boxes
    within boxes.

    The "fix" to the box model is box-sizing: border-box which includes padding and borders into
    the element's width.
