Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
    By default, inline elements do not force a new line to begin in the document flow. Block elements, typically cause a line break to occur. This can be changed using CSS.
    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely?
    is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor
    If there is no ancestor then it will move with the body of the page.
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
    padding or margins.
    4. Name 3 elements that are display block by default, 2 elements that are displayed inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
    Display Block : <div> , <h1> - <h6>, <p>
    Display inline : <span>, <a>
    Display inline-block: button
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model? 
    The CSS default box model takes element dimensions and dumps padding and borders on top of them. The result is tightly spaced elements that constantly are overlapping onto each other and breaking the entire layout flow.
    The solution to this problem is to use `box-sizing: border-box` in your css.
