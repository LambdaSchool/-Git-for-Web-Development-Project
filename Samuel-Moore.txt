Stretch git tasks

Merge conflict:   They happen when multiple changes are done over different versions to the same elements, whether they are to the same document or file. Since the changes are to the same file that is trying to merge, there is a conflict as to which version gets added.
	To resolve the conflict, you may need to make changes to the competing lines of code that are causing the conflict. You may also have to resolve the conflict locally before the change gets pushed to the repo.

Commands: pull, rebase, merge:
	pull will get and merge changes from a remote server and merge them into your own working directory.
	rebase change the base of a branch from one commit to a different commit. It will look as if you hav created the new commit from a different one. 'While the base may look the same, it is made of different commits' You would use a rebase to make the version history appear more linear. It will give a cleaner, more logical move when looking back at earlier versions. Conflicts may be more common with a rebase since there might be longer branches off of the master that are not included and need to be incorporated into the new rebased version.
	merge: is used to integrate changes from one branch into another. The branch that receives the changes is the head of the branch tree. Some complications would be merging elements into a stable branch that cause instabilities in the head code of the branch.
