  Just for comparison I decided to leave the first attempt at this assignment. I'd say I have made some improvement in the comprehension of the material and application.

This is my December 2019 project for Git for Web Development Project 1;

 Review questions:
    
    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element? 
    
        Block elements take up the entire width of the page, while inline elements only occupy the necessary width of the content.

    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
        
        An absolutely postioned element will be placed regardless of other elements or formatting, independent from the flow of the code.
    
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
        
        I believe using the absolute value might be part of the solution.

    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default 
        
        Button, input, and text-area all are set to block by default.

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. 
        
        The CSS Box Model is used describe wrapping each HTML element in it's own margin, padding, and border. This allows for maximum control of placemnt in styling with CSS.
        
        What is the fix for the box model?

        Removing padding and borders from an element and imbedding one div inside a second, and then setting the margin only on the inner div eleminate the confusion of the box model.
