    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
    inline element takes up only the space it needs
    block elements take up all the space across the screen


    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
    I can explain it when I use google but I'm not sure when/how to use it.



    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
    selector {
        display:inline;
        width:value;
    }


    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
        Block:
            <div></div>
            <header></header>
            <footer></footer>
        inline 
            <a></a>
            <br>
            <span></span>
        Inline-Block    
            no idea :/
            I know that you can change the display of an element to inline block using the display property



    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model? 
        From the inside out;
        Content, Padding, Border, Margin

        Border is not the same as Margin
        i.e if you background-color:black and increase the padding, the backgroudn color will grow with the padding. The margin will always be the white space between 2 elements and will not increase the size of the background-color.
