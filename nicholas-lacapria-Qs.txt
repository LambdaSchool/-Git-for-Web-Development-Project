Pen questions:
1. What is Semantic HTML? 
Semantic HTML is an older style of HTML used before name clashes would start to occur. Its a markup language that let you custom name and style your HTML tags. Its helps to reinforce the meaning of information in web pages.

3. What is an attribute and where do we put it? 
Attributes help define additional characteristics of an element. They can be found at the start of of the specified tag you consist of a name value pair which is enclosed in parenthesis. An example is the class or id attribute in a div <div class='classAttribtues' id='onlyId' > 

4. What is the h1 tag used for? 
How many times should I use it on a page? 
It's the largest there is out of 6 different headings though other headings can be styled with larger fonts. You should typically want it to be the single most largest heading on the page. Any heading h1 - h6 used should only be a on a page one time.

src in the <img> tag <img src='file.jpg' > or href in the <a> tag <a href='page.php'>

<title>, <link>, <script>, <meta>, <style>, <base>, <!Doctype html> <html>

7. What is an id? 
An id names a element and can only be used one time or you would be better off naming it as a class. 

8. What elements can I add an id to? 
id is a global attribute and can be added to any HTML element though I recommend adding it to a div element that is unique and will only be used once.
