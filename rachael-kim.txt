Stretch Review questions: 
    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
        -block element takes full width available and inline element only takes up only the width needed.
    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
        -element sits on its own layer separate from all other elements on the page.
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
        -use inline-block
    4. Name 3 elements that are display block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default, and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
        {block: <div>, <h1 - h6>, <header & footer>} {inline: <span>, <a>} {inline-block: <button>}
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model? 
        Box model is padding, border, and margin wrapping around html elements(actual content). Fix for the box model is box-sizing which allows us to include padding and border
        in the width and height.
