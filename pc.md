## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git?
a distributed repository
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
github is an online website used to submit your respository to a massive database for sharing with others, git is a list of commands to facilitate using a git respository.
3. Why do we create a branch?
to store your own work separately from others until it's ready to be merged to prevent errors and facilitate better participation with others on a group project
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?
to retrieve data from the origin/server to be stored on your local device
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.
checkout
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?
git pull simply brings server data to your local system, while git merge combines yours with the main branch, and git fetch retrieves a HISTORY of changes made, not the actual changes themselves, from the server to your local machine
7. What is a merge conflict?
a conflict between two commits where they're both changing the same line of code.
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?
by altering the changed code or picking one line of the commit over the other
