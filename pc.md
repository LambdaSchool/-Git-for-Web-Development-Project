## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git?
Git is the subfloor to the operation of opensource computer engineering.
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
Git is a command to interact with Github in a terminal.
3. Why do we create a branch?
In order to experiment with a code on your local machine under your own user name. This is done for many reasons, like troubleshooting problems or updating a version.
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?
To update the branch with the most recent changes.
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.
Using the git checkout command.
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?
git fetch looks at the most recent changes in a remote repository. Git merge combines branches. Git pull will update your local repository with the most recent updates on the remote repository.
7. What is a merge conflict?
It is when there are two competing changes to a repo.
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?
You open the file in a text editor and delete the operator signifying conflict in order to complete a selection of which change is to be made, with a comment at the commit. You then use the pull request to merge the files.
