## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git?
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
3. Why do we create a branch?
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?
7. What is a merge conflict?
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?

3.) Branching isolates your work from other team members if working on the same project.

4.) a pull request is used to update the local version of a repository from a remote

5.) The command used to switch between branches is "git checkout" and "git switch" followed by the name of the branch you want to switch to.

6.) 'git fetch': Used to download contents from a remote repository

'git merge': Lets you take the independent lines of development created by the git branch and integrate them into a single branch

'git pull': Updates the local version of a repository

7.) A merge conflict is an event that takes place when Git is unable to automatically resolve differences in code between two commits.

8.) To resolve a merge conflict caused by competing line changes, you must choose which changes to incorporate from the different branches in a new commit.
