## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git?

A distributed modern version control system used for tracking changes in computer files and source code. It allows multiple developrs to work together by utilizing non-linear devlopment through its thousands of parallel branches.

2.What is the difference between Git and GitHub?

Git is a DVCS designed to manage all code source history whereas Github is a online hosting service for git repositories.

3. Why do we create a branch?

To make changes to the source code that can be saved and reviewed without changing the main.

4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?

So that the changes to the code can be reviewed and tested before being merged with the main.

5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.

The commmand is git checkout to switch between branches.

6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?

'Git Fetch' allows you to see changes to the remote repository without having to bring them into the local repository. 'Git Pull' brings the copy of the remote directory into the local repository. 'Git Merge' is a command that allows you to combine the other branches with your main to integrate the changes made.

7. What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict occurs when both branches you are trying to merge changes some part of the file and it cannot combine the two without the conflicting changes being resolved.

8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?

By finding the conflicting code and editing it until it works well.
