## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. 
Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the 
[GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). 
Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. 
A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. 
Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. 
If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git?
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
3. Why do we create a branch?
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?
7. What is a merge conflict?
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?


1. Git is a version control system for making sure you can recover code if you or a team member messes something up
2. Github is a service that manages the code you push with git
3. We create branches to safely work on new code without messing with main by accident
4. The purpose of a pull request is to have the code created in a branch checked for issues before its merged
5. The command to use would be git checkout -b
6. Git fetch is the same as Git Pull but doesnt attempt to merge automatically, and git merge just combines branches
7. A merge conflict is when two branches have competing commits that cannot be resolved automatically
8. To resolve a merge conflict you should look at the issue and edit files accordingly
