## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git?
Git allows us to store code, keep track of changes, and collaborate with other
developers.
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
Git is the actual command that we're gonna be running in the terminal and github. 
is the cloud that holds the repository
3. Why do we create a branch?
We create branches to do any fixes, developing fetures based on the main branch
without being in the main branch itself. It is good for if multiple people
are working on the same branch, It will be less traffic and less bumping heads.
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?
The purpose of a pull request is to be able to access the project and allow
any kind of contribution to happen.
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.
The git command would be git checkout.
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?
The difference between git fetch is that it is only recieving the data, git merge
basically merges both the old and the new data. Get pull does both grabing the
data and merging it together.
7. What is a merge conflict? 
A merge conflict is an event that occurs when git
is unable to automatically resolve a difference in code.
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?
You can do git merge --abort and it will put you back before the merge. That
doesn't resolve anything however, to resolve the issue you can accept the current
change, accept the incoming change, accept both changes.
