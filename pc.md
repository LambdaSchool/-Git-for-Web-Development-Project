## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git?
Git is an open source distributed version control system that allows you to make changes to a project speerately from other developers that make also be working on that project.
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
git is local to your device and files. GitHub stores all the different changes and files and more than just you can access and edit the files and repos stored.
3. Why do we create a branch?
It allows you to make changes to that specific version, without making those changes to the master version, so change can be tracked before possibly merging with the master.
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?
it allows changes to be reviewed before being added to the actual project.
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.
git checkout (other branch name)
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?
git fetch: rebuild previous history of the specific branch that needs changes.
git merge: integrate changes made in another branch
git pull: updates current branch and all remote branches 
7. What is a merge conflict?
this happens when multiple developers are trying to do the same thing, and it confuses the system.
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?
choose which changes to incorperate in a new commit.
