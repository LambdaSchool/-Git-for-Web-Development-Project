## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git?
Git is a open source version control system. Git helps you keep track of changes to files.

5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.
git checkout main
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?
git fetch downloads new date from a remote repo but does not add any new data into your working files, git pull updates your head branch with latest changes 
from the remote server. Both are used to download new data from a remote repo. Git merge merges everything together, combines everything into one. 
7. What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict is when Git is not able to resolve the differences in the code between two commits automatically due to merging branches having competing commits.
