git fetch allows team members to download changes from a remote repository to their local machine, git merge is the positive conclusion to merge changes and commits and git pull is to submit changes to be queued for merging to main branch.
7. What is a merge conflict?

In these cases, Git cannot automatically determine what is correct. Conflicts only affect the developer conducting the merge, the rest of the team is unaware of the conflict. Git will mark the file as being conflicted and halt the merging process. It is then the developers' responsibility to resolve the conflict.
