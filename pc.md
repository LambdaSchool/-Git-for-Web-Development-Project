## Research Questions 

	Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git?
	Git is an Open Source Distributed Version Control System. 
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
	Git is the information and code that is to be stored. GitHub is the "warehouse" git is stored in where it can be shared.
3. Why do we create a branch?
	One reason is so that if multiple people are working on one project, the code won't get overcrowded and malfunction. It is also essential when working on a project to ensure that the code is accurate and complete before it's put into the main code.
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?
	It allows the branches to be connected to the main project. 
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.
	You can use git branch command then git checkout branch name. 
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?
	Git fetch shows previeous changes to see history. Git merge is for bringing together several branches without updating the main. Git pull is for bringing branches together, but it updates the main as well. 
7. What is a merge conflict?
	It's when a merge of branches doesn't merge correctly.  
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?
	You can choose which branch you want to keep the updates on or go through them individually to identify the problem.
