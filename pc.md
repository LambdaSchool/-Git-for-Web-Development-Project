## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git? Git is an open source version control system
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub? Git allows you to work and make changes and Github is the cloud where its all stored.
3. Why do we create a branch? So we dont change the main and that way we can test our changes without changing the original work
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request? lets us tell others about the changes we made to a branch
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main. git checkout main
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do? git fetch downloads the changes from the remote to local repos. git pull downloads and merges the changes into your current branch. git merge will combine commits into one unified history
7. What is a merge conflict? when you merge branches that have competing commits and git doesnt know which changes to put in the final merge
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict? open the confilicted file and make necessary changes then use the git add command to seperate those changes and then git commit to explain what was done.
