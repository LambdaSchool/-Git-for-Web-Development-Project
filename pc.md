Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git? A version control system.
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub? Git are the commands where Github is the collaboration site.
3. Why do we create a branch? To be able to do work without changing the main file.
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request? To have your work looked at by team members for possible change.
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main. git push -u origin branch-name
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do? Fetch downloads contents from a remote repository. Merge is gits way of putting a forked history back together again. Pull is downloads content from a remote repository and updates immediately the local repository.
7. What is a merge conflict? An event that git is unable to resolve differences in code between two commits.
