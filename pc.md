## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git? Git is commands we are allowed to use in the terminal	 
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?  Git is a version control system used for tracking changes in source code. GitHub is a web based Git repository hosting service, it is a cloud used to store code and allows people to work together using git to make changes.
3. Why do we create a branch? We create branches beacause at times there is too many people working on one repository. Creating a branch(copy) aloows you to work on the same copy on your personal computer without creating a jam.
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request? To merge Fixed or new code on a seperate branch, back to the main branch.
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main. CD(change directory) cd .. will take you from firstname-lastname to main
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do? git fetch will download the source tree to check for changes, git merge joins your current branch with another branch, git pull is a way to perform a combined operation of git fetch and git merge with a single command 
7. What is a merge conflict? merge conflict is when multiple developers are trying to edit the same code, 
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict? This is where branches are used, They allow the developres to work on a copy of the same code in a different branch to avoid overload
