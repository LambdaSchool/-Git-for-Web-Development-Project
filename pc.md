## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git?
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
3. Why do we create a branch?
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?
7. What is a merge conflict?
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?

1. Git is an open source distributed version control system. 
2. Git is a software, versioin vontrol system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history. Github is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories.
3. Creating a branch allows you to make a working copy of the repository isolated from the master branch in order to make changes.
4. The purpose of a pull request is to update the local version of a repository from a remote.
5. The command used to switch between branches is  cd 
6. Git fetch is a promary command used to download contents from a remote repository. Git pull is the command used to update the local version of a repository from a remote. Git merge lets you take the independent lines of development created by the git branch and integrate them into a single branch.
7. A merge conflict is what happens when Git is unable to automatically resolve differences in code.
8. Open the conflicted file and make any necessary changes, then use the ' git add a ' command to stage the new merged content, finally create a new commit with the help of the git commit command. Git will then create a new merge commit to finalize the merge.
