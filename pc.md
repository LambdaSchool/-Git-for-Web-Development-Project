## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git? Git is a Version control software. 
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub? GitHub is a code repository and Git is a command line interface 
3. Why do we create a branch? Branches are created so that code can be edited, added onto or fixed that doesnt effect the main. 
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request? To merge changes.
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do? Fetch brings down everything from remote to local that isnt there. Merge - merges two branches into one. Pull - merges changes from remote to local.
7. What is a merge conflict? A merge conflict is when Git cannot figure out which version of a file to use when attempting to merge branches. IE, two developers were editing the same lines in a file. 
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict? Using Git status after recieving the conflict to see what Git points out the issue and and make a correction based off what is displayed and recommit.
