## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git? Git is an Open Source Distributed Version Control System
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?  GitHub is the company that hosts the service.
3. Why do we create a branch?  Branching allows you to keep your work separate from others who are working on the project.
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?  Pull request updates the local version from the remote version of repository.
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.  cd ..
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do? 'git fetch' downloads all history from the remote tracking brances; 'get merge' combines the branch's history into the current branch; 'get pull' updates current local working branch with all new commits from remote branch
7. What is a merge conflict? When there are competing commits, Git needs help deciding which change to keep in final merge.
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?  Manually edit the conflicting file to select the changes you want to keep.
