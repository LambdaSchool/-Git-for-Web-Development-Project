## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git? Git is a free version control system that is capable of
handling both small and large projects. 
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub? Git allows you to manage
and keep track of the version of your code locally on your computer. Github
is a cloud that allows you to manage the information/code in Git. 
3. Why do we create a branch? We create a branch so that we can work on the
code without affecting the main branch of work. 
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request? A pull request allows you to 
communicate the changes you've made to a branch with your team so they can 
review and add their opinions and commits before the decision is made to to 
merge your branch into the main branch.
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.
The command for switching between branches is git checkout.
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge`  and `git pull`. What does each command do?
git fetch downloads commits and files from the remote repository into your
local repository. 
'git merge' puts the branches that are separate from the main branch together
to create a single branch. 
'git pull' is used when you need to get and download information from a 
remote repository and immediatley updates the local repository with that content.
7. What is a merge conflict? A merge conflict happens when you are trying to 
merge branches that have commits that don't match each other. Git will need you to decide which changes you want incorportated.
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict? You resolve a merge conflict by
deciding which changes you want merged into the main branch of code.
