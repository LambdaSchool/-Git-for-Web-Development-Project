## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git?
Git is the version control system that lets us track and edit our documents. 
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
Git is where you make the changes and GitHub is where you store and send all the changes. 
3. Why do we create a branch?
To create a staging area to work in. 
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?
To allow you to compare the code to the main branch. 
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.
git checkout main
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?
Fetch will recognize change but not bring it to a local repository unlike git pull. git merge will merge the code on the repositories specified. 
7. What is a merge conflict?
When attempting to merge your code you run into a problem where they cannot merge together. 
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?
Recheck the code within your newest edit to see if you can fix it, or simply delete and restart.
