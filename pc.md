## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git? Git is a software for which the orignal source code is made freely available and can be modified.
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub? Git is a verison control system which tracks changes to source code over time. Github is a web-based hosting service for Git repository to bring teams together.
3. Why do we create a branch? So we can create another line of development that is different or isolated from the main stable master branch.
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request? It enables easy peer-review of the code. Everyone can comment on the changes and ask questions before merging any piece of work.
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main. git checkout
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do? Git fetch downloads the contents from a remote repository. Git merge lets you take the independent lines of development created by git branch and integrate them into a single branch. Git pull is a command used to update the local verison of a repository from a remote.
7. What is a merge conflict? Merge conflict is when we try to make some changes to the same file.
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict? Accept the local verison and run: git checkout --ours <file name>
