## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git? Git is a version contol system.

2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?Git is the actual software used by developers while Github is the area that stores your git content

3. Why do we create a branch? We create a branch when working with people on a similar project which helps developers not "step" on each other when programming

4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request? To compare code between branches.


5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.  git checkout main

6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?
  'git fetch'- Downloads commits and  files from a remote repository into your local repo.
  'git merge'- Combine multiple sequences of commits into one history
  'git pull' - fetch and download content from a remote repository which updates the local repository to match that content

7. What is a merge conflict? This is when a git is automatically unable to resolve  differences in code between two commits
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict? You click on the pull request.
                                        Click on the pull request that has the merge conflict.    
                                        Near the bottom of the pull request click resolve conflict.
                                        Resolve by deleting the not needed content including the conflict markers.
                                        Click on mark as resloved.
                                        Then commit your changes by clicking on the commit merge.
