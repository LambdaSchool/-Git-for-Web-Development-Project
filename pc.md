## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git? open source distributed version control system able to handle small and large projects.
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub? Githus is a cloud-based service, let's you manage Git repositories
3. Why do we create a branch? To not make changes on the main file.
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request? let's you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main. The commant would be git checkout and name of branch
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do? Git fetch, fetches the changes while git pull merges them after fetching.
7. What is a merge conflict? Event that takes place when Git is unable to automatically reseolve differences in code between two commits.
