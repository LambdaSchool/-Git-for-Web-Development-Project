## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git? Git keeps track of all the changes made to files in a directory on your computer.
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?  Git is more designed for code. While Github is designed for storing the finished coded projects.
3. Why do we create a branch? Branches are used for testing out little changes in a code so whether if it fails or not it doesn't have a drastic effect on the main branch.
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request? A pull request can allow you to suggest, receive, and address changes or issues to a specific project even if its your own or someone elses.
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches?
"cd"
 For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do? git fetch, is able to download commits and files from a remote repo, it also allows you to see what others are working on without making changes to their work. git pull, pulls and downloads content from a remote repo, it also is able to merge that content with your own existing content and update the local repo almost immediately. git merge, allows you to take the independent lines of development on smaller branches and merge it together to a single branch, the command puts the forked history back together into one again.
7. What is a merge conflict? A merge conflict is when people make different changes on the same line of the same file in a code. i.e.,  one person could be editing a file differently and another person either deletes the file or edit the same file on their own terms.
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict? You can either resolve merge conflicts locally by using the command line or make a pull request on Github using the conflict editor.
