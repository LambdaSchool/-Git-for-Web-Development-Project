## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git? (Git is a Program that tracks changes in files)
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub? (Git tracks files and GitHub is built on top of it.)
3. Why do we create a branch? (to differentiate from the main branch)
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request? (It's to compare changes submitted by a user, whether it's acceptable or not.)
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main. (git checkout -b 'FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME)
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do? ("git fetch" reviews changes before committing to your local branch, "git merge" takes the changes from one branch and puts them in another, "git pull" refers to when you're fetching changes and merging them.)
7. What is a merge conflict? (a merge conflict difference that occurs between merged branches.)
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict? (It must be resolved before you merge the branches.)
