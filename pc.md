## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git? 
Git is an Open Source Distributed Version Control System
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
Git is the system of operations whereas GitHub is the center that collects and holds all the data.
3. Why do we create a branch?
Creating a branch allows multiple people to work on a project while leaving the original code intact. When one is working on a new set of features to add to the code, the branch is where the new code will be worked on.
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?
A pull request is used to grab data from an already established piece of code. This code is then worked on within something called a branch.
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.
<cd ..>
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?
Git fetch is used to retrieve new work made by other people. Git merge is used when you want to combine local changes with changes made by others. Git pull is used as a shortcut to combine git fetch and git merge.
7. What is a merge conflict?
Merge conflict occurs when you merge branches with competing commits.
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?
Resolving a merge conflict requires manually editing the conflicted file to select changes that you want to keep in the final merge.
