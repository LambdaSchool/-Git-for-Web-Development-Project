# Git Pull: information on https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/syncing/git-pull
The git pull command is used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that content.
Merging remote upstream changes into your local repository is a common task in Git-based collaboration work flows. 
The git pull command is actually a combination of two other commands, git fetch followed by git merge. 
In fact, pulling with --rebase is such a common workflow that there is a dedicated configuration option for it.

# Git Rebase: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing
The first thing to understand about git rebase is that it solves the same problem as git merge.
Both of these commands are designed to integrate changes from one branch into another branchâ€”they just do it in very different ways.
example: git checkout feature  or condensed version git merge feature master
         git merge master



# Git Merge: https://dev.to/neshaz/how-to-use-git-merge-the-correctway-25pd
At some point, a piece of code will reach a state where you'll want to integrate it with the rest of the project.
This is where the git merge command comes in.
1. Check if your local repository is up to date with the latest changes from your remote server with a git fetch.
2. Once the fetch is completed git checkout master.
3. Ensure the master branch has the latest updates by executing git pull.
4. Checkout to the branch that should receive the changes, in our case that is master.

Merging
Once the preparations are completed, you can start the merge with git merge hot-fix command.
