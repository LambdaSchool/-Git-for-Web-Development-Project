it would depend on what command line operating system you are using. also you wouldn't be in a file. you'd be in a directory or a folder. files are stored in directories. to be in a file you would need to open it using a program. Assuming you are using Bash, PWD will print the working directory on screen.

Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
Block elements start a new line, they create a hard line break. 
Inline elements do not create a new line. You can position inline elements inside block elements, but not the other way around. 
A div is a block element, a span is not. Other inline elements include <em> <a> and <img> 

    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
if you position an element absolute you can position other elements in relation to it. 

    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
I really am not sure how you would this. 

    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model? 
The box model is just how you lay out a website. Everything has a box drawn around by default. Every element, every image, everything is inside of an invisible container. 

CSS allows us to stretch, squash, color, animate, distort, transform, move these boxes.
