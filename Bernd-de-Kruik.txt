    37. Walk me through Lambda's git flow. 
            Student will create OWN version of Repo (Fork)
            Student will add TL as a collaborator
            Student then will Clone Repo
            Student will then create a branch (on which the student will implement the project) git checkout -b 'firstName-lastName'
            Student will then submit their PR into the new branch.
            Student will use their own student fork as the base (compare across forks).
            Student will add their TL as a reviewer on the PR
            TL then will count the HW as done by merging the HW back into master “STUDENT FORK”.
            Why would you learn this flow?
            You will work in a specific environment when you go out and get a job as a software developer.
            Learning a broad approach to different git strategies will help you thrive in any specific environment.
            Some strategies you will see in the real world are:
            Forking
            Branching
            By learning this flow, you will become a master of both forking and branching.
            Also, here at Lambda School, we have hundreds of students working with dozens of TLs every day. This flow will help you all collaborate on your work together.
            We will have a firm understanding of where you’re at with your skills and abilities as you continue to progress.

Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
        a block element will break a line and use the size allocated by the parent element, while inline can be inside a line and is defined by tags. 
        block = litteral block not allowing sibbling elements left/right of it while inline does allow sibblings left/right of it.
    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
        it's location is fixed to the body of the site, regardless of other elements.
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
        display: inline-block
    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
        Article, aside and address.
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model? 
        Distribution of different parts which form around an element. Margin is around the border, allowing to create space between borders for instance. This creates quite the mess since it builds up layers around the content.
        The fix for this is the box-sizing: border-box, which instead setting the inner borders sets the outer border (aside from margin) and shapes the content size depending on the different layers.
