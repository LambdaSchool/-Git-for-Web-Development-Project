    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element? Inline elements do not force a new line to beginin the document flow.
     Block elements cause a line break to occur.
    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely?
     What is happening is the absolutely positioned elements are positioning themselves in relation to the body element-
      instead of their direct parent.
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
    { position: absolute;
Top:50px;
Left:50px;
Right:0;
Bottom:0;
Overflow:auto;
Background-color:yellow;
}
    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default,
 2 elements that are display inline by default ? <div> <span class=”highlight”></span> </div>
 1 element that is display inline-block by default? <div> <p class=”highlight”></p> </div>
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model? The box model wraps around every HTML element.
