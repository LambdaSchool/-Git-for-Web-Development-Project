Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
    let's see i know you can't put a block element inside an inline element. an inline element
    doesn't cause a line break and doesn't take the full width of a page
    and a block element always starts a new line and takes up the full page from left 
    to right
    a span is an inline element and a div is a block element 

    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? it's taken out of the flow
    like it doesn't exist

    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have 
    the ability to give it a width? 
    this sounds like a box model thing. padding, width, height, margin and border. you can
    give your element width and still make sure it takes up only the required amount of space

    4. Name 3 elements that are display block by default, 
    2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display
     inline-block by default
      three elements that are block elements by default are html, css and p 
        two elements that display inline by default are the <em> tag and the <a> tag 
        one element that is display inline block by default is <img>

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model? 
    the box model is the content wrapped in the border, padding, margin. like a blanket. 
    it's used when talking about design and layout and it's essentially how every page on 
    the net is. 
    i looked up the second question and found an article i think it sounds like it relates to that 
    question there.
    something called box sizing border box which includes padding and border in an elements 
    width. 
  im still not 100 percent on these answers to some of these questions. lol.
