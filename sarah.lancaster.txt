Stretch Questions

    inline - does not cause a line break and does not take up the full width of the page
    block - will cause a break; always starts on a new line and takes up full width afvailable

3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
    width property sets width of element's content area (not including padding, borders, or margins)
    i.e.    .salmon{
                width=80%
            }
